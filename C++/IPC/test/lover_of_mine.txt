I'll never give you away
'Cause I've already made that mistake
If my name never fell off your lips again
I know it'd be such a shame
When I take a look at my life
And all of my crimes
You're the only thing that I think I got I right
I'll never give you away
'Cause I've already made
Already made that mistake
Lover of mine
I know you're colorblind
I watched the world fall from your eyes
Ooh
All my regrets
And things you can't forget
Light them all up
Kiss them goodbye
Dance around the living room
Lose me in the sight of you
